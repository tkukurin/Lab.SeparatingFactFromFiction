## Scraper
Multiclass and binary have overlapping Tweets (multiclass is a subset of binary). Not all Tweets
are available because some accounts were suspended in the meantime. In total, our scraper collected
105914 of them.

## SyntaxNet
SyntaxNet is installed [via Docker](
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/syntaxnet/g3doc/CLOUD.md)), find sh
convenience scripts in the `syntaxnet` directory.
